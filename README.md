# HDLT
Highly Dependable Location Tracker

## Implementation Steps
To facilitate the design and implementation of the system, students are encouraged to break up the project into a series of steps, and thoroughly test each step before moving to the next one. Having an automated build and testing process (e.g.: JUnit) will help students progress faster.
Here is a suggested sequence of steps:
1. Implement the user to user protocol that allows a given user to produce an acceptable location proof. For simplicity, a statically defined grid could be used.
2. Simple server implementation without dependability and security guarantees. Design, implement, and test the server with a trivial test client with the interface above that ignores the crypto parameters (signatures, public keys, etc.)
3. Develop the client library and complete the server â€“ Implement the client library and finalize the server supporting the specified crypto operations.
4. Add the functionality of the HA client.
5. Extend the system to support the dependability and security guarantees
specified above, namely tolerate Byzantine users.
